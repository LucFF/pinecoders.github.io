## Trusted Pine Programmers for Hire
These are Pine programmers we know and endorse, who have a good reputation of providing quality, paid Pine custom-coding services. While you can inquire to any number of them, it is considered very poor etiquette to send bulk inquiries to all. These programmers are all very good, and they are also very busy. Finding one who is free and willing to work with you will sometimes be a challenge.

Business transactions are to be carried between you and them. Neither PineCoders nor TradingView will be involved in your relationship with the programmers, and we do not benefit from your business with them.

If you have a project to code:

- Start by writing down a clear and complete description of your project. The better your description, the more chances you have of finding someone who will code it, and the less chances you will suffer cost overruns because of changes you make to requirements as development proceeds.
- Use each programmer's intro text to select those that seem best-suited to your project.
- PM them and send your description with other requirements.
- They will tell you if they are free, if they require more information, and often provide suggestions or alternatives.
- If they want to work with you, they will provide an estimate of the costs so you will be able to decide if you want to pursue the project.

> Tip: As we mentioned, these are busy people. Trying to negotiate unreasonable prices with them will not be to your advantage, as programmers will simply choose other customers to work with.
